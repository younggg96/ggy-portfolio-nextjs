## Overview

Ascendio.ai is an intelligent AI-powered stock analysis platform that combines real-time financial data, social sentiment, and AI reasoning to help investors make data-driven decisions.  
The platform employs **autonomous LLM agents** that continuously monitor financial news, earnings reports, and social media signals, generating summarized insights, sentiment analysis, and potential trading signals in an easy-to-digest dashboard.

Designed for both retail and institutional users, Ascendio.ai bridges the gap between traditional market analytics and next-generation AI-driven intelligence.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis Agents**:  
  Deployed FinGPT and custom LLM pipelines that read, summarize, and rate news, SEC filings, and Twitter/Reddit discussions to determine real-time sentiment per stock.

- **Multi-Source Data Aggregation**:  
  Integrated APIs from MarketPro.ai, Alpha Vantage, and NewsAPI to unify price data, company fundamentals, and sentiment scores into one cohesive dashboard.

- **Agent-Orchestrated Insights**:  
  Designed a multi-agent system where one agent fetches live data, another interprets trends, and a final “Decision Agent” synthesizes trading-grade insights with confidence levels.

- **Real-Time Visualization Dashboard**:  
  Built an interactive Next.js 14 interface for visualizing price charts, social sentiment timelines, and AI-generated summaries with Tailwind + shadcn/ui.

- **User Personalization & Watchlists**:  
  Implemented dynamic portfolios and personalized watchlists, where each user’s agent adapts to preferred tickers, sectors, and risk profiles.

- **Secure Authentication & Access Control**:  
  Added NextAuth.js with AWS Cognito federation, JWT session callbacks, and tenant-level RBAC for enterprise users.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React Server Components, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts
- **AI & Data**: OpenAI GPT-4, FinGPT, HuggingFace Transformers, MarketPro/Alpha Vantage APIs
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js, AWS Cognito, JWT
- **Backend & Storage**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM, Redis for caching real-time data
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + AWS Lambda (API), Cloudflare CDN
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions CI/CD, Serverless Framework

## Architecture Highlights

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration

The platform uses an **LLM-Agent-based pipeline** where agents specialize in different tasks:

- **Data Agent** → Gathers market + news data
- **Sentiment Agent** → Performs NLP classification using fine-tuned FinBERT
- **Decision Agent** → Generates trading signals and human-readable summaries
- **Feedback Agent** → Learns from user interactions to refine scoring weights

This modular design allows plug-and-play upgrades for each agent type (e.g., FinGPT → Claude 3 Sonnet).

---

### 2. Hybrid Rendering & Performance

- **Server Components (RSC)** for data-intensive analytics and SEO pages
- **Client Components** for user dashboards, filters, and live data streams
- **Edge Caching** and **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** for near-real-time updates

The result is an ultra-fast, interactive experience with sub-second TTFB and smooth client hydration.

---

### 3. Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture

Ascendio.ai supports enterprise teams through isolated data environments:

- Tenant-scoped database schemas with Prisma + Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for admin, analyst, and viewer roles
- Encrypted JWT sessions with Cognito tokens (access, ID, refresh)

---

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Sentiment Data Quality**:  
  Social media signals are noisy and inconsistent; solving this required building a weighted scoring system combining multiple data sources (Reddit, X, and news).

- **Real-Time Streaming**:  
  Maintaining live updates while minimizing API costs led to a hybrid polling + WebSocket architecture using Redis Pub/Sub.

- **Model Interpretability**:  
  Users needed transparency in AI-generated insights, so explainability layers (SHAP-like feature attributions and confidence meters) were added.

- **Authentication Complexity**:  
  Integrating NextAuth.js, Cognito, and JWT session rotation across tenants demanded custom session callbacks and encryption management.

---

## Outcome

Ascendio.ai successfully launched its **beta program** with over 1,000 registered users and several pilot institutional clients.  
The system delivers **AI-driven market intelligence** with measurable results:

- **Accuracy**: 82% average alignment between AI sentiment and next-day stock movement
- **Performance**: Average LCP < 1.3 s, API latency < 200 ms
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture supports 1000+ concurrent sessions
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability via Vercel + AWS Edge stack

Ascendio.ai represents a new generation of AI-powered financial analysis tools, demonstrating how multi-agent LLM systems can augment human decision-making in complex, real-time environments. The platform showcases advanced skills in:

- AI/ML engineering with multi-agent orchestration
- Real-time data processing and streaming architectures
- Financial technology integration and compliance
- Full-stack SaaS platform development with Next.js 14
- Enterprise-grade authentication and security patterns
